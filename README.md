# Individual Bootstrap Project

### Instructions:

* Now you have a better understanding of Bootstrap, you can use it to style your own webpage.
* Please choose a website theme of your choice - perhaps a page about one of your interests, or a pretend business page.
* Use Bootstrap to style the page - **you should use no (or very little) CSS**!
* You have approximately 2.5 hours.
* It may help to plan your page before you start. This could be a good chance to practice making one or more low-fidelity wireframe(s). :-)

### Ideas:

* Some Bootstrap styles you may wish to bring in to your project:
    - Header
    - Nav bar
    - Bootstrap grid
    - Cards
    - Footer
    - Anything else that interests you - remember that Google and the Bootstrap docs are your friend if you want to research other ways of using Bootstrap!

* **Important** Also try to include some responsive styles using Bootstrap - for e.g. try to ensure you have a design that works on small (mobile) screens in a different way to medium and larger screens. No CSS media queries allowed!

### Goals:

* To build on yesterday's work on Bootstrap, and spend some time getting used to using it.

### Resources:

* The Bootstrap Docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/
* Bootstap cheatsheet: https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/
* Your Github Classroom repos from yesterday. :-)

### Good luck, and have fun!
